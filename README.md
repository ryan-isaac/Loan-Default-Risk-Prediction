# Loan-Default-Risk-Prediction

## Introduction
Risk management is a main concern for any institution. However, for financial institutions it is the most crucial part that goes hand in hand with their strategies and profit goals.  Risk managers almost always want to have more conservative approaches, while marketing/sales managers might oppose them as their main objective is more short term - increase sales, reach targets and sell their services/products- without looking into other risk factors that could affect the future financial position of their company.  Therefore, risk management is very important; it makes sure that the company's exposure to risk could not jeopardize the financial performance in the future.  In banks for example, risk management deals with determining how much risk the bank can afford to take.  customers applying for loans and credit cards must meet the minimum guidelines that the risk management sets for the specific bank.  With the increased adoption of data science in the financial sector, banks can use some tools to help them identify the risk corelated to each customer profile using some historical data.  Using mathematical algorithms to identify the risk is relatively a new approach but it has gained a lot of popularity among data scientists and has become one of the common use cases for data science in the financial sector.

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that could identify customers with loans who are most likely to default from a pool of clients with loans using a real historical dataset from the year 1999.  Although the data is irrelevant to today's market, the approach and analyzing methods can still be applied to new datasets and the model can be chosen following the same concepts demonstrated in this project.

## Data and Tables
This project uses historical bank data from 1999 and is limited to this data for training and testing.
In this model, labels are used from loans data with 682 loan profiles.
The type of model is Supervised learning, as the labels are already provided as follows:
'A': 'Loan is paid in full and the contract has ended'
'B': 'Loan contract period has passed, and the status is default',
'C': 'Payments are made during the contract period with no current default', 'D': 'Loan is defaulted during contract period'
